# Sci-Hub_Bot
Hello there!
This is my first telegram bot in python, and it's capable of managing connection to the official Sci-hub page available and interacting with the user to 
download the desired papers. If you need it, hope you like it!

ps.: in case you have problems running it fell free to contact me at issues or my personal email: 

 > rubenesteche@hotmail.com 

## Requirements
  
  * `scholar.py` package already included in this repo to avoid bugs due to future branches
  * `telegram.ext.py` which can be conda/pip installed fromm cmd line easily by official site instructions
