# Google Scholar Bot
Hello there!
This is my first telegram bot in python, and it's capable of managing connection to the official Google Scholar page available and interacting with the user to 
download the desired papers. If you need it, hope you like it!


## Requirements
  
  * `scholar.py` requirement already included in this repo to avoid bugs due to future branches
  * `telegram.ext.py` which can be conda/pip installed from cmd line easily by official site instructions
